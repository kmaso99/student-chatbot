# 🎓 Student Chatbot SQL Assistant

This project is a collection of interactive Jupyter notebooks designed to help students learn and practice SQL queries in a conversational, guided format. It simulates a chatbot-like experience where users are prompted through increasingly complex SQL tasks using real-world datasets.

## 📘 Project Overview

The notebooks walk through:
- Basic SQL syntax and query structure
